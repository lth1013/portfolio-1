## Learning Points 


I learned a lot from this application. I was able to practice my skills with CSS, Git, and HTML. Specifically, I was able to practice creating a website that had a nav bar with links, a responsive environment, inserting images with text over them, and using flex. My learning foundation was greatly increased by this project.
